OVERVIEW OF THE REQUIREMENTS
Project Description:
This project is a mobile application built with Flutter, leveraging a Laravel backend API to provide robust data management, secure authentication, and seamless integration with the app. The app allows users to interact with backend services—such as user management, data retrieval, and CRUD operations—ensuring a responsive, consistent user experience across devices.
Purpose and Goals:
The primary goal of this project is to create a user-friendly mobile application that enables efficient interaction with data stored on a remote server. The Laravel backend serves as the core API, managing requests, handling business logic, and ensuring data security. Flutter is used for its cross-platform capabilities, allowing the app to run on both iOS and Android with a single codebase irrespective of their versions. Key goals include:
•	Providing a seamless user experience by managing complex data operations.
•	Ensuring a secure, scalable backend API that supports future feature expansions.
•	Offering a cross-platform mobile app to maximize accessibility and reach.
Technologies Used:
•	Frontend: Flutter (Dart) for building the mobile application with a modern, responsive UI.
•	Backend: Laravel (PHP) to handle API requests, authentication, and data processing.
•	Database: MySQL to manage and store user data.
•	Development Tools: Composer for dependency management in Laravel, and Postman for API testing.
•	Deployment Platforms: AWS/Heroku/DigitalOcean (to be chosen based on project needs) for server hosting. N/BThis is for later deployment for market use.
Core Features:
•	User Authentication: Secure user login and registration using token-based authentication.
•	Data Management: CRUD operations for managing user-related data.
•	Cross-Platform Compatibility: Accessible on both Android and iOS with a single codebase in Flutter.
•	Real-time Sync: Ensures real-time data sync between the Flutter frontend and Laravel backend.
Project Structure:
The project is divided into two main parts:
1.	Backend (Laravel): Handles API requests, data validation, authentication, and serves as the main data source.
2.	Frontend (Flutter): Provides a responsive and interactive mobile user interface, calling API endpoints to interact with backend data.
Expected Outcome:
A secure, scalable mobile application that allows users to access services and manage their data conveniently. This project also establishes a reusable API structure that can be expanded with additional services or used as a foundation for future mobile applications.
